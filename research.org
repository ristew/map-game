study of a small coastal Lycian town
only connected to sea
located in ok natural harbor
limited sources of fresh water
15km from larger trade hub
coastal towns vulnerable to raiders
walls and town built at same time
late 4th bc to 7th ad
main export good is purple dye from sea snails
likely not sustained by local agriculture (though there was some)
largely lacked docking facilities


** shipworm
https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1006/ijna.1996.0013
shipworm would mean a ships lifespan is 2-7 years unless protected
ex the kyrenia ship had lead sheathing and lasted 15-25 years
ships, especially warships, would be stored dry on land
largely drying over winter to kill shipworm
warships also beached nightly
increase lifespan to 20 years
fir is lighter than pine and cedar as a shipbuilding material
ship wetness/soundness was a disadvantage at battle
