* the sea
** Aperlae, cabotage
https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1006/ijna.2000.0281
study of a small coastal Lycian town
only connected to sea
located in ok natural harbor
limited sources of fresh water
15km from larger trade hub
coastal towns vulnerable to raiders
walls and town built at same time
late 4th bc to 7th ad
main export good is purple dye from sea snails
likely not sustained by local agriculture (though there was some)
largely lacked docking facilities


** shipworm
https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1006/ijna.1996.0013
shipworm would mean a ships lifespan is 2-7 years unless protected
ex the kyrenia ship had lead sheathing and lasted 15-25 years
ships, especially warships, would be stored dry on land
largely drying over winter to kill shipworm
warships also beached nightly
increase lifespan to 20 years
fir is lighter than pine and cedar as a shipbuilding material
ship wetness/soundness was a disadvantage at battle

** piracy!
kyrenia ship a possible victim
** kyrenia ship
lead sheathing
possible piracy victim
main cargo of 400 wine amphorae from rhodes
crew of 4


* production
** mettalurgy
* culture
** writing
start with the hieroglyphs
hieroglyphs morph into proto-sinaitic in ~1800 BCE
phoenician alphabet developed in ~1200 BCE
phoenician led to greek alphabet in ~800 BCE
but with vowels!
standardised in 400 BCE

* Ownership and Exploitation of Land and Natural Resources in the Roman World
real economic growth implies higher division of labor
market integration drives specialization
allows farmers to grow regionally optimal crops instead of substinence
olives and grapes are more labor intensive than grains
maybe propulation growth drives productivity by forcing better use of land
technologic change in roman times (at least agriculture?) limited to watermills, oil press, and sturdier cattle
cities drive demand for commodities like olive oil
"Changes in surplusproduction in the Mediterranean region were probably much more the resultof changes in the structure of landholding and the wider economy than oftechnological innovation"
peasants engage in subsidiary labor when not needed for agriculture - marginal gains + access to wages
typically seasonal in nature
textiles made in cities, estates, and peasant households
textiles from wool or flax
